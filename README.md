# 🔐 ABC Company - Secure VLAN Network Design

A full-scale, real-world inspired **secure enterprise network design**, originally developed as the final project for *CIS-221 (Principles of Information Systems Security)* under **Professor Talia Q** at UFV.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project simulates a production-ready, layered-security architecture that integrates:

- 🔐 VLAN segmentation
- 🔥 Cisco ASA Firewall (DMZ, Inside, Outside)
- 🌐 Cloudflare protection + TLS/WAF/DDOS
- 📶 Secure Wireless via Cisco WLC + planned RADIUS
- 🔑 Role-based ACLs
- 🧾 Centralized Syslog Auditing
- 🛜 HSRP high-availability Layer 3 core switch
- 🧠 VPN with MFA & split tunneling
- 📦 Full configuration exports (.pkt, .txt) for real-world testing

> ⚙️ Verified in Cisco Packet Tracer

## 📽️ Inspired By Two Outstanding Professors

### 👨‍🏫 Professor Talia Q — *CIS-221 (Information Systems Security)*
Professor Talia Q’s deep teaching and hands-on labs sparked the entire vision behind this project.

His **network forensics labs**, **Kali Linux demonstrations**, and **real-world insights** into layered defense strategies fundamentally shaped this work.

### 👨‍💻 Professor Samuel Okegbile — *CIS-192 (Networking)*  
His **comprehensive VLAN architecture lectures** and 3+ hour walkthrough on **secure hierarchical designs** laid the foundation for this network’s structure.

> 📺 [Design and Implementation of a Secure Company Network System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbv95OxT1FM)

> 💡 With his guidance, I implemented:
> VLANs, ACLs, ASA Zones, WLC Wireless, DHCP, Inter-VLAN Routing, IP Phones, HSRP, NAT, EtherChannel, STP Guard, OSPF, SSH hardening — and more.
